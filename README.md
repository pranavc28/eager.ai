<p align="center">Next.js Flask OpenAI api project that is an AI software engineer interviewer copilot. Uses multi agent systems, vector embeddings, and direct LLM calls. In particualr we have implemented an RAG drafting system based off https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08223 </p>

<br/>

## How It Works

Mostof the main code is in the api folder. The main files are:

- `api/index.py` - the main file that runs the Flask server and maps the API routes.
- `api/two_sum.*.py` - the file that stores data for questions! This is a sample question that I did not scale up since there was no need.

The main purpose of this project is to show how to use multi agent systems, vector embeddings, and direct LLM calls. I already have tonnes of experience in database design, distributed systems, and backend development, so I did not focus on those aspects much.
